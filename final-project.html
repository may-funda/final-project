        <p>Matthew Carter is a designer from Britain who designed lots of the typefaces we use in our daily lives. Carter studied traditional punchcutting to make metal type while he was an apprentice. Then he designed digital typefaces for computers that were used from the 70s to the present day. Some of the fonts he created are Snell Roundhand, Bell Centennial, ITC Galliard, Charter, Big Caslon, Carter Sans, and more.  </p>
